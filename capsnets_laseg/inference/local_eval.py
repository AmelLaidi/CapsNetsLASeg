    """
    Loads raw data, preprocesses it, predicts 3D volumes slicewise (2D) one sample at a time, and pads to the original shape.
    Assumptions:
        The segmentation task you're working with is binary.
        The multi-output models output only have two outputs: (prediction mask, reconstruction mask)
        The .nii.gz files have the shape: (x, y, z) where z is the number of slices.
